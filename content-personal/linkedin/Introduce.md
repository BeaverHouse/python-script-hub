Hello, I'm Hyunuk Lee from South Korea.

I'm currently working mainly as a backend engineer using Python.
Also working on Kubernetes maintenance & other DevOps stacks like Argoâ€¢Elasticsearch since the late 2022.

Furthermore, I also can use some frontend stacks like React, and recently interested in Flutter and trending Kubernetes-based DevOps technology.

I majored in chemical engineering, not computer science. Therefore, I may have weakness at some theoretical basics or other experience. I'm trying to overcome my weakness and learning for various IT technologies and concepts.

Ever since I was young, I've always been an introverted person.
It'll be rare that I make contact to someone first, but I'm always open to productive conversation.
Feel free to contact me!
